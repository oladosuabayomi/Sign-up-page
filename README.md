## A Responsive Split-screen Sign-Up Page (HTML & CSS)

This is one of my personal project as a Web Developer (Newbie). In this project i created the Sign-Up page of a company that treats Dogs. 

This is to test my knowledge on basis HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheet) concepts like:

<li> HTML Forms 
<li> CSS Floats 
<li> CSS Background Image
<li> Media Queries (for responsive Designs) etc.
